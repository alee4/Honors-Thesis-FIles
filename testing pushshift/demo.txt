this would imply that they were all operating web crawlers with the same bizarre behavioral glitch (more on this in a moment) which all not only coincidentally started crawling ao3 at the same time, but also hit the same pages in roughly the same order. this is exceedingly unlikely.\n\nfurthermore, this is not as simple as clicking a link. it has to load and execute a bunch of javascript to get a session ID token which must be provided along with the form data in a POST request... in other words, it's pretending to be a regular web browser, and poking at something that a search engine indexer wouldn't care about. this behavior at the very least implies that the bot was designed to maliciously exploit HTML forms, and (to me at least) strongly suggests that it was designed specifically for ao3.\n\nnotice we haven't even considered intent, and yet just by looking at the material facts we've persuasively narrowed things down to this: a single entity is using ~300 proxies and a bot which is specifically designed to pretend to be a regular web browser in order to exploit unsecured HTML forms. the only reason we have to doubt this hypothesis is given by the tumblr user: they argue that renting 300 proxies would be too expensive, because they believe that the only ways to do so involve either renting a botnet or 300 instances of amazon's cloud VPS product. this is simply not the case. as i said in a previous comment, proxies are widely available on black/gray hat forums, because they are often used for SEO hustles and such. i don't know how much these cost, but it is certainly less than a vps. that actually doesn't matter though, because there's a much easier option: tor.\n\njust moments ago, as a test, i loaded up tor browser, navigated to a fic on ao3, and left 5 kudos in a row by simply refreshing the tor circuit. i am tempted to code up a bot using this approach just to prove how easy it would be, but rather than inflict that on the world i'll just say with [torsocks](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torsocks.git) and [selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) anyone with even a beginner's understanding of scripting could produce it just from the description i've given here.\n\nso that's what i think is going on. no idea why they're doing it, but the barrier for entry is so low that the motivation doesn't need to be very strong at all. i've written more destructive bots just out of sheer boredom.", "body_sha1": "5445f3c92991185c9bdf7b17c5f5ce122a11d56b", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1636685140, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "hka9f1p", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_qoq8oi", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_hk9xpuu", "permalink": "/r/HobbyDrama/comments/qoq8oi/hobby_scuffles_week_of_november_8_2021/hka9f1p/", "retrieved_utc": 1636685150, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "HobbyDrama", "subreddit_id": "t5_k4fie", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/HobbyDrama", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null}, {"all_awardings": [], "archived": false, "associated_award": null, "author": "wrldruler21", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_htia3", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "body": "Content agencies gave me a start for my second career.

I guess my question really is, is it better to build on something that I already have an exposure on or does it pay off to learn a completely different skill?", "body_sha1": "22b73eade6b9e87fc76d6d40d555c68309b95d90", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1636683980, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "hka6vwv", "is_submitter": true, "link_id": "t3_qrmm92", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t1_hk9wjaa", "permalink": "/r/buhaydigital/comments/qrmm92/video_editing_vs_web_development_using_wordpress/hka6vwv/", "retrieved_utc": 1636683995, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "buhaydigital", "subreddit_id": "t5_40th7s", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/buhaydigital", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null}, {"all_awardings": [], "archived": false, "associated_award": null, "author": "EyesWideSurreal", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a1gr2ywq", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "body": "Haha fuck. \u201cDOGELON MARS\u201d \n\nI\u2019m studying SEO currently and I just realized, with this name alone.

But yeah either way I couldn't feel the sparks.\n\nThe fact is that I felt that a lot of moments were kinda cringy, I remember that the only korean BL I felt this way was with \"You Make me Dance\", which is the same director of \"My Sweet Dear\", it may be the fact that this boi doesn't know how to write normal and non forced conversations, but yeah...something felt off.\n\nIt could be also that they abused the quantity of montage like scenes, every single episode had a damn montage scene where they where laughing and \"being happy\" while music was in the background, which is aesthetically pleasing of course (specially the beach scene which was kinda beautiful), but sometimes an excessive amount of montage-like scenes can make a romance storyline to feel fabricated and unnatural, just like shiny plastic.\n\nThey also played really safe and it disappointed me and sort of annoyed me. I mean they already had two attractive famous actors, one of them being the kBL king jang Eui Soo and a mainstream actor, they already had an interesting setting and good music, they already had invested fans, and the success stories of many Korean BLs before them and still...the story was hella short and there was almost non existing kisses. The story also plays in the most predictable way, the director just loves plot where one of them betrays the other in a  really awful way (both My Sweet Dear and You Make me Dance).\n\nThe chemistry felt kinda weird, because some scenes felt kinda idk \"overly sexual\", like the licking hand and heavy breathing scene, like dude wtf, and still no real kisses, no real intimacy. When I watched it, I just felt like I was watching two straight actors doing fan service, not two man falling in love. I mean, in To My Star there is a hand kiss but it has meaning, this is Ji Woo subconsciously protecting Seo Joon at all times, so it feels really really sweet. In My Sweet Dear it is just kinda...there.\n\nI don't really know that happened, Eui Soo in Where your eyes Linger really touched me, I could feel the love, struggle and the tension between Gi Chan and Eui Soo, so raw and beautiful. It must certainly be director.\n\nConclusion: aesthetically pleasing drama with good music, great actors, interesting setting but with no deepness.", "body_sha1": "a9385dc6fd45b70f1769f3c40b000d28444ef359", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1636680463, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "hk9zafa", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_qry7q3", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_qry7q3", "permalink": "/r/boyslove/comments/qry7q3/my_sweet_dear_finale_ep_78/hk9zafa/", "retrieved_utc": 1636680475, "score": 1, "score_hidden": true, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "boyslove", "subreddit_id": "t5_2sbdb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/boyslove", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null}, {"all_awardings": [], "archived": false, "associated_award": null, "author": "bselite", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_a8422", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "body": "In my opinion I\u2019ve found Moz to be a waste of money as it\u2019s not very accurate and can\u2019t really give you any insights that Ahrefs is giving you. \n\n\nIf you\u2019re going to double up on any all-in-one SEO software then I would lean much more towards an Ahrefs / Semrush combo than what you currently have.", "body_sha1": "b0473039425ad19cfa3dd5f3ec3662baa5437205", "can_gild": true, "collapsed": false, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "comment_type": null, "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": 1636680107, "distinguished": null, "gilded": 0, "gildings": {}, "id": "hk9yjgq", "is_submitter": false, "link_id": "t3_qrw2f4", "locked": false, "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_qrw2f4", "permalink": "/r/SEO/comments/qrw2f4/ahrefs_vs_moz_pro_any_features_that_justify/hk9yjgq/", "retrieved_utc": 1636680118, "score": 1, "score_hidden": true, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "SEO", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qhbx", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/SEO", "subreddit_type": "public", "top_awarded_type": null, "total_awards_received": 0, "treatment_tags": [], "unrepliable_reason": null}, {"all_awardings": [], "archived": false, "associated_award": null, "author": "FroggFunseekah", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_4htbs7y8", "author_patreon_flair": false, "author_premium": false, "body": "Seo, my dear friend, thank you for the endless hours we traveled together through the wonderlands of time and space in Eorzea.
