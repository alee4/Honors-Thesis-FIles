Quick2Die,1,"&gt;We ~~shouldn't~~ *don't* need mandates, ~~but~~ we are nearly 2 years into ~~this pandemic.~~ destroying the global economy over a virus that has a weighted 1.9% mortality rate for all age groups with a weighted 0.44% mortality rate for people 64 and under (which is the vast majority of the worlds population) and is only severely impacting people over the age of 65.

Phew, glad we fixed that one!

&gt;Here are the facts. We had 1,550 new deaths from COVID yesterday.

That is SO cool! Hey, did you know that [in 2019 an average of 8,159 people died every day?](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/united-states-population).

&gt;Which is more than half the people who died in the attacks on 9/11.

So? A comment like bring very little to the conversation. 

&gt;Total death count for COVID is now over 770,000.

If you were to split that into the years that the death occurred, [like every other mortality statistic that the CDC tracks](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm), the number is a little differant. Lets have a look at [the count as of December 31 2020](https://www.ajmc.com/view/a-timeline-of-covid19-developments-in-2020), and look this reported that ""more than 346,000 deaths"" from COVID in 2020. Which means as of today (12/1/2021) there have been... wait this cant be right the math says there has been over 432,000 covid deaths this year!?!?!? Anyway, the numbers if they were being reported like any other disease;

Covid deaths in 2020 = +346,000

Covid deaths in 2021 = +432,000


&gt;For some perspective, around 60% of the US is fully vaccinated, which is pretty good but not great considering that there were over 108,000 new cases confirmed yesterday.

Well hold on, I think you dropped something. Here are some facts that you conveniently left off... going back to the group of people who this virus is really harming, those who are 65 and older, the CDC says that 99.9% of those people have at least 1 does and 86.6% are fully vaccinated. It also says that 82.7% of people older than 18 have at least 1 dose and 71.1% are fully vaccinated. Now for everyone under the age of 17 are at a 99.999% recovery rate for covid infections so there really is no need for those people to be vaccinated but even those people are pretty highly vaccinated 63% to 69% fully vaccinated.

For some fucking perspective... your 60% number includes people between the ages of 0 and 4 most most of which are not even allowed to get the majority of any available vaccines, so what the fuck game are you playing at using that number? 

&gt;BUT.... the overwhelming majority of COVID deaths are people who are unvaccinated. 

the fact that this is even an argument is actually comical considering they were saying shit like [*All the Covid-19 vaccines prevent death and severe disease, and that's what matters, experts say*](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/22/health/covid-vaccines-prevent-death/index.html) but hey, fuck me for not believing CNN, right?


&gt;The facts clearly support that vaccines prevent death. Identity politics have been around forever, but the merging of the fringe anti-vax movement and right-wing politics is a mistake that you can help fight against.

No, the facts clearly support that vaccines prevent symptoms and severe illness caused by a covid infection. NONE of the published studies claim that vaccines prevent death, because the vaccines don't prevent death. Anyone who claims that is a fucking liar.

As for the ""anti-vax movement"" it is a myth. You clearly have no real understanding of why people oppose this vaccine. Nearly every single person who opposes this vaccine are totally in favor of every single other vaccine that has ever been produced ever in the history of modern science... Maybe you should ask yourself why that is? 

&gt;We all wanted the pandemic to be over.

It is over, it has been over for a long time from a policy stand point. The only reason why its not over is because you gave the federal government the power to dictate ever aspect of your life in the name of public health. the pandemic will never be over for you because of that. they will forever have new variants of concern and will perpetually mandate your life in the name of public health because you let them. 

&gt;Instead of everyone embracing the vaccine as a solution, it just became another issue to take a side on.

Yea, the FDA gave approval for this vaccine to a company that they sued for lying to them and breaking rules while developing drugs... then the SAME  FDA turned and is trying to hide all of the related trial date for the next 50 years... if that doesn't scream corruption then i have no idea what does.

&gt;You can still hold all your other ideals but please reconsider your stance on this.

We have considered our stance, that is why we haven't gotten the damn shot yet... or does that simple logic not compute?

&gt;Protect yourself and protect your loved ones. Please do the right thing and get vaccinated and then get your booster.

Edit: BTW Roe vs Wade within the ruling they stated that this ruling would have to be revisited due to the fact that at the time they didn't have the technology to determine when life began in the womb.

That's literally what an ad hominem is. Unless the argument is whether or not someone (in this case Seth Rogen) is a liar (which isn't what Seth is claiming in the quote), calling someone a liar is always an ad hominem. You can call his statement false if you'd like, though you'd have to provide evidence or an argument as to why it's false, but calling him a liar doesn't refute his statement. 

&gt;No, moron, pointing out that someone is a hypocrite regarding the core topic they are spouting off on correctly targets them to be ignored. 

Even if I am a moron, that doesn't make my statement false. This, too, is an ad hominem. 

Calling people hypocritical when that isn't the statement presented (again, the statement from Seth would have to be saying he isn't hypocritical) is also an ad hominem.  

In other words, your arguments are errors in logic. You also seem to be getting emotional about this. When arguing I have found it best to remain calm.

&gt;‚Ä¶I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation‚Äôs summers of riots are caused by our nation‚Äôs winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.

Listen to what I just said. Im not running from an argument but I‚Äôm definitely not participating in something that goes further into false pretenses.   

I do agree with a lot of what you‚Äôre saying but I‚Äôm not sure how you fix the incestual abuse toward a minor who is under the care of the abuser.

I think outside of basic rhetoric we both agree it‚Äôs an issue of autonomy, proper sex education, raising responsible men, etc, but until we‚Äôre able to live in a vacuum outside of nuance, we‚Äôre more than likely better off not removing options for women and rather changing the what this discussion is truly about",-1

tenebrapetrichor,1,"I still don't know why this mRNA therapy is being pushed so hard. A tradional attenuated or inactive would have worked just fine, and far fewer people would have fought it. 

Attenuated is a live virus that's mutated in an animal very different in biology to humans. Think chicken or frog. We use them now with Measles, mumps, season flu.

Inactive is dead virus. These would be polio, hep a, rabies. 

Far less severe adverse effects. And we know what to expect bc we have been using them for decades. They still need to go through trails however. 

Both have their pros and cons. If I was to be picky then attuated all the way, but both are better then this mRNA thing.

What makes Omicron interesting is that from what I've read it has significant mutations we wouldn't expect to see normally. Between the synthetic origin of covid and the selective pressure of mRNA vaccination we are seeing an old virus developing some novel characteristics.",-1

Let's look at the items in your article:

1. 10-hour waits - The exception, not the rule. We've already covered this topic
2. Naked ballots and other strict rules - Printing out a ballot is not an unreasonable request. Also, it is only if you're mailing in your ballot. Not having a security sheet to hide your information in the envelope is incredibly easy to do. None of the items mentioned in the article are actually hard at any level. 
3. Long drives - How many does this affect? Mostly rural living individuals vote Republican. Their overall numbers are small. How many are allowed to request a mail-in ballot or absentee ballot? Almost all of them. This is not a hardship for just about anyone.
4. ID laws - The only country in the G20 that doesn't universally require identification to vote is the US. Calling voter ID laws a hardship or restrictive is something a 4-year-old might argue. It's obviously silly.
5. Roll purges - If you aren't registered properly in the place you live, you shouldn't vote. That's not hard to understand. Everyone that wants to vote, should vote. You just have to be motivated to do what's necessary. Changing your address when you move is incredibly easy, and in most states, your address attached to your voting registration can be changed online.
6. Prison voting bans - When you are a ""rehabilitated"" felon, you can have your vote back in many states. In other words, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.",-1

Yeah, sorry doesn't sit right or feel good to me and feel it's worth fighting back on.   
  
To be clear I have both had COVID and been vaccinated, but I believe in choice. And listen if the vaccine actually did what they claimed it was supposed to by preventing illness at high percentages and proven with open and honest data to be safe, I might even be more open to something like an immunity passport, as long as it included natural immunity as well.

KlorgBaneTD,1,"The best response in practice I think is to ask them when exactly ""the switch"" occurred. 

FDR was the first Democratic president in history to receive the majority of the African American vote, but if the switch really did happen, then it had to have been post-FDR, because FDR was a raging racist who put Japanese Americans in internment camps and nominated an active KKK member to the supreme court (Hugo Black). Meaning it couldn't have happened before the forties.

It also couldn't have been before the sixties, because the Democrats elected Lyndon B. Johnson in the sixties, and he has a terrible track record on race. From opposing anti-lynching laws, having to be *heavily* pressured into signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and of course was famously quoted as saying ""These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us,"" and perhaps even more famously saying ""We'll have those 'n-words' voting democratic for 200 years"".

Maybe after the sixties then? Well, probably not, considering as recently as 2010 Democrats have honored memes of the KKK. Robert Byrd is the best example I think, as you have Bill Clinton specifically addressing his Klan membership at his funeral, and stating that it was justified due to him using it for the purposes of getting elected as a democrat. Even Obama refered to him as ""a voice of principle"". 

This doesn't even really touch the deep-rooted racial issues that the modern day DNC finds itself at the center of. Which are even easier to dig up than the information above. 

Also, if you're interested in this topic specifically, Dinesh D'Souza has a book called ""The Big Lie"" that crosses paths with this idea pretty heavily throughout. I'd definitely recommend giving it a read.",-1

I'm not learning disabled. But through high school I have known several kids who were. They were all great kids that put as much effort, if not more, than kids who were not in IEPs. 

&gt;The fact remains that disruptive students should be removed from a classroom so that others can learn without interruption.

When a student is disruptive a teacher deals with that student accordingly. It doesn't matter if they are in IEP or not.

Crunkbutter,1,"This isn't refuting what I've said about the standardized testing. This is a major factor in the decision, moreso than race or artificially inflating graduation numbers.

Because the testing is flawed, it is artificially lowering graduation rates to a degree. We're almost certain to see an uptick in the number of graduates, but again, the schools still have a GPA average and mandatory curriculum to meet before graduating. There are still academic standards in place. Washington state doesn't use a mandatory standardized test as a graduation requirement. I don't see why everyone is acting like they're throwing the baby out with the bathwater with this.

Regardless, OP made this about race when he posted that bull shit clickbait as if it was the entire story.",-1

Normal_guy420,1,"1) You are ignorant. This is NOT normal behavior for a kid in IEP. I suggest you do some research on kids with learning disabilities, how they act, what their problems are, and how accommodations are made for them in a classroom. If you did even 5 mins of research on this topic you wouldn't be making these ignorant statements.

2) you are the stupid one. You actually have no idea what you are talking about and you are making absurd maximalist statements saying kids with learning disabilities are jerking off on other kids in calculus class. You're a great example of the dunning kruger effect, where you are confident in your knowledge about a topic you have no idea about. Once again, kids with learning difficulties do not go around jerking off on other kids. Literally just do 5 mins of research on what an IEP is and what kinds of kids are involved in it and you will realize how stupid your statements are.",-1

my_son_is_a_box,1,"On the contrary, I would say that standardized tests have actually hampered the education process. When schools are judged off a single metric, it makes the metric the only goal. Why give the kids a comprehensive idea of a concept when you know you're judged off their knowledge of a date? it's totally counterintuitive to your point. 

Frankly, education is difficult to quantify, as there is no concrete purpose of education, either for America or most other nations. Is it to ready workers, inspire curiosity, or babysit kids? TBH, its a bit of each. No single metric is going to encapsulate each if those goals, so using one will only lead to failure. It's the reason that kids are taught that Nazis are bad, but never given any kind of clear idea of what fascism is. 

Is America falling behind? In many ways, sure. However, gen z is going to be the most educated generation in world history. Our faults don't lie with education, but in many economic sectors. Then again, that's a whole different discussion, one I don't especially wish to big myself down in right now.

Also props to actually knowing the story. Most people see a headline and do no further research (that's both sides)",-1
